* Zenosaga.com // ~Project Z~ / Open Source Code Release 1.0 *
==============================================================

I am releasing the PHP 4.0 source code of Zenosaga.com to 
the fans of the Xenogears and Xenosaga series and vestigial 
members of the Zenosaga.com community. I don't guarantee 
that anything in this release will work or parse properly 
when served using the latest production deployment of LAMP
and then opened in contemporary browsers. Besides code 
clean-up and packaging the original source codes haven't 
been touched since late 2005. I began writing the original 
Zenosaga.com source codes in 1998 around age 19 and throughout 
my early 20's as a vehicle to learn PHP while I was still 
majoring in Computer Science in college. Some of you may be 
aware of Zenosaga.com's unreleased successor, the ORMUS 
Society, aka Zenosaga 3.0. That was an entirely separate 
project in itself, built completely from the ground up and 
using knowledge that was harvested from operating 
Zenosaga.com for 4.5 years. The codebase for the ORMUS 
Society is completely different than that of Zenosaga.com. 
I began writing the codebase for the ORMUS- Society around 
mid 2004, when a noticeable drop in the frequency of 
updates to the original Z became apparent to the general 
public.
 
The source code release for Zenosaga.com only contains the
PHP codes and necessary index.html files; no associated
resources or assets such as images, SQL databases (table 
schemas, however, are included as text files) or other media 
files are packaged. I haven't looked at the original Zenosaga.com
source codes since I closed it down in 2006 and would be
embarrassed to compare my coding style of yore to my coding
style of today. I probably would not be able to address any 
questions regarding functions or classes surrounding this 
release. Having a large collection of codes such as that of 
Zenosaga.com lying stagnant around for more than a decade tends 
to create a self-inflicted form of amnesia, know what I'm saying? 
 
The original project was written and designed around PHP 4,
powered by Zend Engine 1.0. On the grounds of HTML and
CSS 2, it was designed around Internet Explorer 6 - which at 
the time dominated Internet usage with over 90% adoption rate.

==============================================================
* Some PHP comments in retrospect pertaining to this release *
==============================================================

Some of the functions and classes written included redundant
codes that could've been re-written to perform their functions 
more efficiently and less of a resource hog.

Plenty of resource-intensive functions, especially the PW and
Download Center sections, that made use of the dynamic file
packing, zipping and streaming function which bogs down the
server whenever there were too many calls to it. As such, 
several fail-safe limitation switches were added to prevent 
server outages. Other checks were put in place to limit resource 
consumption, such as checking individual members' download 
ratio vs. community contribution, etc. 
 
Lots of messy coding that resulted in a lot of unnecessary
include() and require() statements.
 
Insecure form of session tracking, which was sufficient for the
site's primary use (i.e primitive language selection, theme-
selection, MyEHQ settings, etc.) but should never be used in an 
production e-commerce environment.

Lots of unnecessary class / object extensions. Subsections of
the main site, such as individual Xenosaga Episode pages
extends up to three sub-level of the main class.

Lots of on-the-fly code bandaging and patch-up throughout the
course of Zenosaga.com's life cycle, this includes incomplete 
features for overtly ambitious features (i.e. U.M.N. Network, 
Eldridge Skylines, etc.,).

These are some of the areas that the initiated the development
of the ORMUS Society and that which the ORMUS Society was
developed to address:

Code efficiency and an enhanced, enriched user experience;
resetting the original and poorly written code and wiping the 
slate clean of the increasingly sordid user experience 
associated with the Zenosaga.com during the tail-end of its
service.

==============================================================
* Some project ideas for users of this code release:
==============================================================

* Create a new, fresh and modern Xenogears or Xenosaga fan site.
* Optimize the PHP codes so that it is compatible with PHP 5.
* Create a Xenogears|Xenosaga-based Social Network extension, i.e
  finish what the "Eldridge Skylines" aimed to accomplish.
* Create a mobile platform-optimized Zenosaga.com site.
* Create a multi-lingual site (Z's ambition, realized in the 
  unreleased ORMUS Society)
* Re-build Zenosaga.com with modern day web technology, e.g.
  HTML5, CSS over tables, etc.
